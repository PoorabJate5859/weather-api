## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **API Key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
  
### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PoorabJate5859/weather-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd weather-api
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser:

   - You can either open the file directly in your browser or use a local server (such as **Live Server** in Visual Studio Code) to run the app.

### API Key Setup

- Open the `main.js` file and replace the `apiKey` placeholder with your own API key from OpenWeatherMap:

  ```javascript
  const apiKey = 'your_api_key_here';
  ```

### JSON Setup for Cities

- The list of cities is populated from a local `cities.json` file. Make sure this file is in the root directory, and it contains a list of cities and their respective countries.

Example `cities.json` file:

```json
[
  { "name": "New York", "country": "US" },
  { "name": "London", "country": "UK" },
  { "name": "Tokyo", "country": "JP" }
]
```

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Select a city from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the **"See Weather"** button to get the real-time weather for the selected city.
4. The weather details (temperature, description, and humidity) will be displayed below.
